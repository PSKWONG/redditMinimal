&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A couple years ago I discovered my library has an ebook app I can download onto my phone.  So, as an experiment, I moved my Facebook app and put the ebook app in its place.  I normally used the Facebook app when doing things like waiting in the lunch line or at the bus stop or something.  I told myself that from there on out, I would read during those times instead of browsing social media.  The results were more telling than I expected.  Here&amp;#39;s what I noticed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I had been checking social media so often that it had become a muscle memory.  For the first few days, I would constantly reach into my pocket, pull out my phone, and open the app, all without realizing.  And then I would be startled to see a sea of words instead of Facebook.  Because I guess reading is something that calls for actual attention, which I wasn&amp;#39;t prepared to give during those times.  But I had no idea how habitually I was checking Facebook until I was doing this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I went to a presentation about criminal justice reform.  When it was getting wrapped up and conclusions were being said, I got bored, and was about to reach for my phone.  But then I thought: if I had a clunky book with me, would I pull it out and start reading it right then?  No, because that would be rude.  Cell phones seem like they&amp;#39;re less rude because I COULD be doing something important, like answering an urgent text.  But is being rude OK as long as you&amp;#39;re disguising it well?  Hmmm.... &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I found myself reading a lot more.  Finishing a lot more books.  Which is great!  Except, it means that I had previously been reading actual books worth of social media on a regular basis.  I find this disturbing to think about.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I came to like ebooks!  They&amp;#39;re much easier for reading on-the-go, and since I&amp;#39;m using my library&amp;#39;s app I can support the library without having to make the trip down there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope I&amp;#39;m not coming off as some old guy who thinks that phones and social media are evil.  I still use social media regularly, including the apps, but this experiment shed some light on problematic habits I&amp;#39;d formed and how I can use this technology more wisely.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;
