# Purpose of the project 

In this project, I am going to build an application for Reddit using everything youâ€™ve learned, including React and Redux. Reddit is a website where people share links to articles, media and other things on the web. The Reddit API provides data which you will integrate into your application. The application will allow users to view and search posts and comments provided by the API.

* HTML
